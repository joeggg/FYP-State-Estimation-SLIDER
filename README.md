# FYP-State-Estimation-SLIDER
Code for my final year project, a position estimator for the robot SLIDER at Imperial College London

The file estimator_SIM.cpp in slider_state/src implements the Kalman filter. 
ground_truth_receiver.cpp interfaces to the correct topics needed for the filter and tracks the error.
